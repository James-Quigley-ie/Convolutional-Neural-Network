# Convolutional-Neural-Network
Python Project to create a consolutional Neural Netowork using only low-level functions. Used in the partial completion of a course project. Submitted as part of a jupyter notebook for ease of viewing results.
## My functions
 - convo: performs consolution on a single image or stack of images whith 1 or more colour channels. Returns stack of convolved images.
 - print_images: displays 1 or more images in each colour channel provided.
 - relu: performs rectified rectifier activation function on a stack of images.
 - pool: perfoms max pooling on a stack of images.
 - norm: normalized a the pixel values in a stack of images.
 - top_layer: Get the activation of a fully connected layer after flattening the feature maps and without bias term.
 - softmax: 1D array reflecting the fully connected layer activation.
